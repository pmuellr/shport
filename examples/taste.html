Hello and welcome to shport! ðŸ‘‹  Here we'll show you the basics of shport, cover a few key concepts, and get you started.

shport stands for **S**imple **H**tml **P**ages with **ORT**.

ORT stands for the [**O**bservable **r**un**t**ime][Observable Runtime].  
This library powers the [Observable Notebooks][], which provides a 
[JS-like language][] to script your notebook cells.

shport provides the same basic capabilities, but in actual JavaScript.
Instead of authoring in a web page, you author your JavaScript in your
favorite text editor, like any other web page.  Learn the handful of
functions available in the shport module, and how to organize the
cells of your page in a \`<script>\` tag, and away you go!

md(`
**shport pages are made of cells**. Another sample:

"Hello, I am a *Markdown* cell; I contain *formatted* **text**.
`)

md(`
When you created that cell, you saw all of the available cell types (currently availableâ€”Observable doesn't sit still):

- JavaScript cells (the default), for logic, calculations, and calls to JavaScript libraries.
- Markdown cells
- HTML cells, for HTML
- TeX cells, for math formulas

The most commonly used cell types are JavaScript and Markdown. Let's do some work with JavaScript cells now. (It doesn't matter if you're a JavaScript beginner; you'll see why in a moment.)

Here is a JavaScript cell that displays data in a table:
`)

variable((Inputs, data) => Inputs.table(data))

md(`
That table is produced with the following variable definition:

    variable((Inputs, data) => Inputs.table(data))

This variable depends on the \`Inputs\` object provided by the ORT, and
a variable named \`data\` which is defined as below:

    variable(function data(FileAttachment) { 
      return FileAttachment("./athletes.csv").csv({typed: true}) 
    })
`)

variable(function data(FileAttachment) { 
  return FileAttachment("./attachments/athletes.csv").csv({typed: true}) 
})

md(`
You could also have attached an \`.xlsx\`, \`GIF\`, \`.json\`, or any
other type of file; the File Attachments page explains all the details.

After attaching a file and viewing its data in a table, the natural next
step is to plot the data. Let's look at a scatterplot based on the
\`athletes.csv\` data:
`)

variable((Plot, data) =>
  Plot.plot({
    marks: [
      Plot.dot(data, { x: "weight", y: "height", stroke: "sex" })
    ]
  })
)

md(`Here's some SVG:`)

svg(`
<svg width=160 height=160>
  <circle cx=40 cy=40 r=40></circle>
  <circle cx=80 cy=80 r=40></circle>
</svg>
`)

md(`Here's some TeX:`)

tex(`E = mc^2`)
